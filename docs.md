## What is Breadcrumbs?

I'll start with **a quick primer**:
The brain stores information as schemas (concepts), and retrieves them through associations. Every memory is accessed through the activation of semantically adjacent ones ("trains of thought" are a great example) —but this is a far cry from how we interface with the internet today. If we could navigate through the internet the way we do our brain, we could access its wealth of information near the speed of thought. The tighter our interface between mind and machine becomes, the more we may consider it a genuine extension of our internal memory.
This last bit is called situated cognition, and I've been studying it—in addition to human cognition and memory—to inform this project's development.

Here's **a practical example** I've been using recently to illustrate the problem that we're tackling:

Say I'm working on a program, and I want to recall the specifics of an insightful solution on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/).
To locate it, I must now think: "What was the title of the posted question?" Now I've got to sift through my browser's search history for the page. If the title was vague, I may open a few and check the solutions for what I'm looking for. Unless you've painstakingly organized your bookmarks into meaningful categories, they won't be of much help, either. Once you find the page, you must then mentally isolate content of interest from the noise. To avoid the inconvenience of rediscovery, we may keep dozens of tabs open—detracting from our limited attention ever more.

**In short**: to (re)discover information on the web, you must conform to the rigid layout of your browser and the sites you visit—which are intent on increasing foot-traffic and user retention, not your productivity. We may recognize when we've fallen victim to the drama and the dopamine, but not so for when we think we're learning. We continue to consume beyond the limits of our working memory because we never learned how to learn things properly. This is the case for Breadcrumbs.

Fundamentally, our solution involves scraping sites unobtrusively for rich contextual data (beyond just domain and title) as you browse the internet, and representing this in an interactable cloud of connections and semantic clusters. We want to do away with messy bookmark hierarchies, tab backlogs, dependencies on third-party ecosystems like Pinterest boards, YouTube playlists, Chrome reading lists, etc... in favor of a "map" to the internet structured much like your own brain.
