Breadcrumbs was originally designed to be an
internet history graphical representation of your 
search habits on the web. Having pivoted to a more 
user-friendly design, some of the design changes 
will be explained below:
Bubbles:
-- Intended to be sessions of search on the web
and easily manipulated by users to their 
convenience. They should ideally be short and 
quick to navigate (using keybinds/shortcuts to 
open and close sessions as well as add/remove with
one button click). The idea is to have them be easy
to use and understand by even the least tech-savy
users.
-- Should be stored natively in JSON files using 
chrome storage API and then processed into trees
on the backend to preserve link heirarchies to 
be displayed to users on the newtab page
-- Ultimately be displayed as a group of data
in visual bubbles on the graph that can be 
further looked into and manipulated on newtab.
Windows:
-- Using chrome windows API's are tricky because
of the neccesary stop-gaps added to them for 
security reasons. For this reason it is difficuly 
to properly use them and some workaround may need
to be found (perhaps using tab groups instead would
be visually better). 
-- Should give the user the choice to add to whichever
session that they want to and allow them to access them 
without being on the newtab page (perhaps through 
context menus or keybind shortcuts).

The Graph:
-- The graph should contain the users bubbles and 
be able to be filtered to the user's preference.
-- Links should be stored in heirarchies.
-- Graphs should not have edges but rather be sorted
by spheres of influence and be assigned an "id" title
that can be renamed by the user. 
-- Context menu's should be present on the side of 
newtab giving users extra context.

Overall our project needed a pivot to focus more on the
user experience rather than gathering massive amounts of
data not only from a logistical perspective but also as 
a stop-gap for future issues.
