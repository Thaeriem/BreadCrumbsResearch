It's safe to say the internet is the largest consortium of information to exist. As humanity's collective receptacle for thoughts, ideas, and findings, it's strange to imagine it serving anything but our own interests. But, through our affinity for instant gratification and that rush of dopamine, our "interests" have been its own undoing, green-lighting the perversion of the web from a paradigm of usefulness to one optimized for consumption and user retention. We've all fallen victim to clickbait or an infinitely scrolling page, and most of us know—to some extent—when we're getting played. But What makes the state of the web so tragic is that, contrarily, when we make a genuine effort to learn and engage, we actually *feel* like its working. We consume neatly packaged explanations and manufactured opinion pieces, amass our hoard of bookmarks and reading lists for "later," and walk away feeling accomplished all the same. We may feel more informed than ever, but our understanding is grossly shallow; this illusion of competence encourages us to consume more and more, committing exceedingly less of it long term memory. We've got the literal greatest source of knowledge at our fingertips, and we're all ill-equipped to handle it.

 I call this the (weak) [[The Bandwidth Problem]]; its a crisis in how we interface with information. While social media extracts its toll in man-hours, this trap silently offs a veritable nation's-worth of minds in intellect gone unrealized. It preys, unnoticed, on the casuals and power-users of the web alike, because virtually *none* of us ever learned [[how-to-learn]]. The greatest source of knowledge wont truly serve humanity until the tools we use to access, store, and browse it are built with our minds, in mind.

**TL;DR**: Naturally, we've bred a web that caters to our tendencies. We may recognize when we've fallen victim to the drama and the dopamine, but not so for when we think we're learning. We continue to consume beyond the limits of our working memory because we never learned how to do it properly.
