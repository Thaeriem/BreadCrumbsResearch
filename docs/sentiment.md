# **PKM: customer sentiment**

### What consumers want in their [PKM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management):
> Mindmapping... various mindmap/knowledge systems exist - MindMeister, Xmind, TheBrain - but they are either clunky, TOO advanced, or not really sufficiently integrated into my workflow.

> A dream piece of software would be a combination of OneNote/Notion/Evernote, Pocket, Feedly, email, and a mindmap to connect it all somehow. A way to collect your inputs (email, RSS, saved articles/webpages), organize them (with tags, notes, etc…) and then make new connections and retrieve ideas.

> Integration. I don’t want [it] to be a browser feature I forget about. I want this annotation layer to be everywhere. So I can search and summon Memex links and annotations instantly, drop them on other documents and connect them together. I want to be able to pull permitted annotations into content management systems easily.

> the key 10x [more useful] feature is effortless ubiquity.

> We don’t need a searchable backup of the entire web - Google does that. We need a searchable, organized, integrated backup of what is actually important to us - which might only be 1% of what we actually browse. Its unfortunate that so much time and resources were lost on it [full history search], but live and learn!

> [in defense of extension [Tabs Outliner](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tabs-outliner/eggkanocgddhmamlbiijnphhppkpkmkl)]: As you open tabs, relatively logical hierarchies/collections are automatically created (search for task managers or falafel recipes and all of the links you open from that search become children of that search. Any further links opened become sub-children). As you close tabs, they are discarded (do we really want to be saving, let alone cataloguing, 90+% of pages that we go to?). The key is to leave the useful pages open and then “archive” them by closing the window through the Tab Outliner tool, and then drag your “curated” hierarchies around a bit to tidy them up, rename things, etc… Its a nearly painless AND faultless system, something that filters, machine learning or manual organization cannot lay claim to.

> Between browser bookmarks, Apple notes, Pinterest, Trello, and Facebook and Instagram saved posts - there's an enormous amount of information I want to document / remember / revisit at a later time (thank you internet) and it's ALL over the place.

> Nested folders requires digging around. 👎
